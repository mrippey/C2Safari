# C2-Safari Searcher

As with many search tools, Shodan queries can become quite wordy and a pain to type in. This tool seeks to ease some of that burden by presenting<br>
the user with a CLI menu of pre-selected queries to search for possible adversary C2 infrastructure. Inspiration for this project came from  from<br>
 Aaron Stephens presentation "Scan't Touch This".
