Like many tools, Shodan queries can be a pain to type in multiple times. This tool seeks to ease some of that burden by<br>
providing the user with a CLI menu of pre-selected queries to search for possible adversary C2 infrastructure.<br>
 Inspiration for this project came from Aaron Stephens presentation [Scan't Touch This](https://github.com/aaronst/talks).

## Getting Started
$ git clone https://github.com/msec1203/c2safari.git
$ cd c2safari/c2safari
$ poetry shell
$ poetry install
$ poetry run 

## Prerequisites
Python3.9
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org)

## Usage
Simply run the script, select a number from the menu and receive the first five results from Shodan.
